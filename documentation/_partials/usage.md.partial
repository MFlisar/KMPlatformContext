This library is used like following:

- on android do following:

  - add the `initializer` module to your dependencies
  - or do following manually inside your `Application` class:

    <!-- snippet: PlatformContextProvider -->
    <!-- PlatformContextProvider -->

- on all other platforms do nothing special

Afterwards you have access to the `PlatformContextProvider.get()` and `PlatformIOContext()` everywhere in your code.
